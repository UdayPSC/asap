So I want to build a water cane delivery web app called ASAP Cane Delivery, In my application the base url will take any one to landing page which has a nav bar in which on the left side I'll have logo and on the write side I'll have 3 options Customer Login, Owner Login
in rest of the page we'll just describe about features and how it helps users also a feedback form, which will not require login just through email id user can give feedback, in footer of landing page Our contact Info which is - Created by A&U, Email id- akshaypratapsingh12345@gmail.com
If someone clicks over Customer login > page for login with email id and password, also link for new user registration, once customers logs in he will be taken to the dashboard page > where in nav bar > leftside logo, right side options place order, order history, and profile option also option to logout
apart from nav bar in dashboard page there will 3 cards> Place order (this card will redirect to place order page which will Include form for placing an order (selecting cane quantity, address(fetch form profile if available) and payment option(COD, or Razorpay)). Integrate RazorPay on a separate payment page.)
2nd card -Previous Orders > this page will list all the previous orders with details like quantity, payment method (chosen by you) and status which you change (pending or delivered this can be changed only for the most recent orders)
3rd card- Profile (this card will redirect to profile page which will include, option to update password, and change personal info like - Name, email, number, address (this will be used when placing the order) and button to update the changes)
Coming to the Owner login> Owner will have only login page as for registering owner that will be done by developer in database directly, after owner login > for nav bar > left side logo which will take back to the landing page > right side option to orders and logout
so I want 2 cards in dashboard for owner > 1st Orders - when owner clicks over it he will be redirected to page where he'll have option switch between active orders and completed depending on status for instance which have status as pending sorted from older to newer and other options as completed for orders where status is set to delivered also owner should have option to filter the order based on payment method, also owner can change status for the orders which are showing in active orders page
2nd card to update or set the price for cane set time like  from what time to what time they will be delivering and if they are not delivering for that day then set status as closed (Just like shops)
This will not impact customer ordering just will be reflected in users dashboard
